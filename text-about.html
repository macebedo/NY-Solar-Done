<h1> #1 in New York and Growing</h1>
<h2>20 Years of Experience and Counting</h2>
<p>NY Solar is one of New York’s oldest solar power companies. We’ve had great success and are starting our expansion into New Jersey. We hope to expand service into other Northeastern states in the next couple years. We want to enable as many businesses
  and home owners to choose solar energy as possible. It’s our dedication to you and our planet that drives us.<br>
  <br>
</p>
<h2>Why Choose NY Solar?</h2>
<p>Of course our vast experience is a great reason, but we think it’s our dedication to you and your custom needs that makes us the best choice. While we offer easy turnkey solutions, we get to know you before we recommend a system. We want to have a
  relationship with you for years and that all starts with getting you the right solution.</p>
<p><strong>Solar Fact of the Day</strong><br>
  NY Solar has been providing solar electric systems for the past 20 years. None of the systems we have installed have needed to be replaced yet.</p>
