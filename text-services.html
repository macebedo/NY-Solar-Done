<h1>We Plug You into Solar Power </h1>
<h2>System Design</h2>
<p>NY Solar offers turnkey solar power systems for commercial and residential applications. After 20 years we’ve become New York’s largest installers of solar power systems. We provide education, system design and engineering, installation, system monitoring,
  maintenance and warranty service. We are a one stop shop that provides all the services you need from start to end.<br>
</p>
<h2> Installation &amp; Monitoring</h2>
<p>We’ll work with you to decide the right type or solar power system your business or residence requires. We’ll install it, then monitor your system’s performance. Customers also have access to web-based monitoring so you can analyze your own system’s
  performance.<br>
</p>
<h2>Consultation</h2>
<p>Let NY Solar’s 20 years of experience designing and installing solar electric systems work for you. We can educate you on various types of systems depending on your particular application.<br>
</p>
<h2>Maintenance</h2>
<p>Photovoltaic cells were originally designed for use in space, where repair is very expensive or impossible. Since solar panels have no moving parts, they are a proven technology and are extremely reliable. We do provide maintenance services such as
  cleaning the array, checking electrical connections, eliminating plant growth that causes shading and anything else required.</p>
<p><strong>Solar Fact of the Day</strong><br>
  All the energy stored in Earth’s reserves of coal, oil, and natural gas is matched by the energy from just 20 days of sunshine. We currently harness only 1% of solar energy.</p>
